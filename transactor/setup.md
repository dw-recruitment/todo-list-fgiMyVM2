Please download datomic-free-0.9.5350 from
[https://my.datomic.com/downloads/free](https://my.datomic.com/downloads/free)
and unzip it in this directory so that relative to the project root, 
the transactor jar is located at
`transactor/datomic-free-0.9.5350/datomic-transactor-free-0.9.5350.jar`

If you have bash, curl and unzip, you can run `"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"/bin/setup.sh` to do this automatically.

## Installation

Please download datomic-free-0.9.5350 from
[https://my.datomic.com/downloads/free](https://my.datomic.com/downloads/free)
and unzip it in the transactor directory so that relative to the project root, 
the files are in `transactor/datomic-free-0.9.5350`

If you have bash, curl and unzip, you can do this automatically.

You can optionally specify the path to a config edn file as the first argument
to the program. The default is in resources/default-config.edn
